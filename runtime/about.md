runtime
=======

This module provides a state for the execution of the scripts.
In general the AST structures are consumed by the runtime in order to produce output or change the internal state.

The main sub-modules are:
 * runtime      _the main state of the interpreter_
 * stack        _the memory store_
 * symbols map  _symbols map storing references to values and function (values as well)_
 * eval         _the module that implements specific actions for each of the AST types_
 * BIF          _stores thte built-in function implementations_

The helper sub-modules are:
 * dbg      _enables recursive tracking of all evaluation operations_
 * rt val   _enables input and output of the values in the stack store_
