TODO
----
 * [ ] Figure out type agnostic (array/tuple) implementation of cons.
   * drift from the lisp operations toward STL e.g. _push-front_ instead of _cons_,
     _front_ instead of _car_, etc.
 * [ ] Improve error messages from BIF evaluation.
 * [ ] Evaluate consistency of the error unwinding.
