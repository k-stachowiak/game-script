TODO
----
- Turn all BIFs into parafunctions and create a clear AST divisions:
    - literals including compounds
    - computation control: do, bind, match, func-def, func-call, reference
    - function-like: everything that works like a function but is a core language construct
- Consider type requirements in the pattern (WHAT SHOULD BE THE SYNTAX FOR THIS???)
- A bind should create "references", i.e. a tuples of address and type.
  This should be a common concept also used by the reference varaibles. Once
  the references are implemented in terms of address+size the metadata may start
  being removed from the stack. There may be optional boxed values for generic
  implementations...
- If type expressions are present, Implement function overloading so that more than one function is allowed
  to be bound to a single symbol and it is not an error to fail binding to the formal arguments if there
  is yet another overload to be considered
- If overloading implemented test different matches
- Serialize functions on the stack and enable execution
- Remove automatic capture from lambdas and require user to bind needed values explicitly.
