TODO
----
- Replace short circuit para-functions like "and" and "or" with "all\_of", "any\_of", etc. algorithms.
- In general get rid of all the para-functions in favor of algorithms and built-in functions
- Consider type requirements in the pattern (WHAT SHOULD BE THE SYNTAX FOR THIS???)
- If type expressions are present, Implement function overloading so that more than one function is allowed
  to be bound to a single symbol and it is not an error to fail binding to the formal arguments if there
  is yet another overload to be considered
- If overloading implemented test different matches
- Serialize functions on the stack and enable execution
