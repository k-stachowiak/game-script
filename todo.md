TODO
----
    - refactor switch to be core based and not tuple based
    - make function call parser accept any expression in the first position and in the runtime check if it evaluates to function object
	- the runtime register of the bound symbols should be realized in terms of a global symbol map
	- implement an std function that would realize bind functionality with placeholders
