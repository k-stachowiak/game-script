    - how to handle printing references if we can have a legal one-past-end refs?
    - upon error the debugger indentation counter doesn't reset
    - enable nested function composition (there is an error ATM)
	- change all the collection algorithms to operate in terms of references
    - enable currying by placing don't care literal in function calls
