TODO
----
    - enable nested function composition (there is an error ATM)
	- consider extracting the function arguments evaluation before the decision ast/bif/clif once all tests pass
    - upon error the debugger indentation counter doesn't reset
	- change all the collection algorithms to operate in terms of references
    - enable currying by placing don't care literal in function calls
	- the runtime register of the bound symbols should be realized in terms of a global symbol map
