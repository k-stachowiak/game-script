front-end
=========

This module is responsible for the lexical and syntactican analysis of the source code.
The output of the front-end operation is an AST structure - a tree or a list of trees.
The symbolic expressions based syntax is supported.

 * **parser**           _parses dom trees or subtrees into AST structures_
